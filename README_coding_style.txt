DR_EVT coding style mostly follows the standard C++ libraries and Boost projects.

+ overriding style is lowercase separated with underbar
+ member fields: `m_*`
+ function names: lowercase with underbar
+ class names: start with uppercase (camel case after that e.g. DataType)
+ templated types: uppercase
  - derived typedef types:  `using value_type = SomeType::value_type_t`
+ header preprocessor guard: `__<NAMESPACE_PATH_NAME>_HPP__`
+ indentation by 4 spaces, no tab
+ comments:
  - doxygen:
    - `/// single line comment `
    - `/** multi-line comment */`
    - `@TODO  - TODO note`

  - inside of a function use `//`
  - outside use a doxygen comment
    - minimize blocks of `//` or `/* */` comments that are not picked up by doxygen
+ for variable names, spell out the full dictionary words as much as possible
  and refrain from using undocumented or unfamiliar acronyms
+ use const keyword when a variable is not supposed to be modified and a member
  function does not update any member state.
+ avoid relying on implicit type promotion or conversion,
  and use explicit casting such as static_cast
+ do not convert an unsigned type to a signed type unless it is algorithmically
  necessary
+ check and fix compiler warnings
+ avoid using `using namespace xxx`, and explicitly specify the
  namespace of each symbol of a different namespace referenced
+ do not put implementation details inside of a class definition body
